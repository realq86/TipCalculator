# TipCalculator

This is my first attempt at the CoderPath's iOS bootcamp application pre-work "iOS Pre-work: Tip Calculator App."
This project is following the instruction found at this link: https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_ios/prework.md

The current version follows the instruction as closely as possible and use variations to my own style only on parts where the instructions were not specifc on what is required.

BASIC FEATURES:

Main calculator view that accepts 2 user inputs: 
  - Total amount of the bill.
  - Level of tip to be paid out of 3 choices.
Settings view that allows the user to choose 1 of 3 tip level to be saved into local storage as the default for the main calculator view.
Setting default values in the correct time of the View Controller Life Cycle.

OPTIONAL FEATURES:

Autolayout for all the views.
UIAnimation to change the alpha values of the tips and total amount field before and after user inputs the bill amount.
